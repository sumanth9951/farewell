    <h1>Farewell, S. Kovendhan</h1>
    <h2>A True Leader Leaves a Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      Working under your guidance has been a true privilege, Kovendhan sir. You werenâ€™t just our team leader â€” you were our strength, our calm in the chaos, and a true example of what leadership really means. Even in your busiest moments, you never turned us away, never lost your patience, and always offered help with a kind smile. <br><br>

      Your dedication and punctuality were unmatched, and the way you took ownership of your work left a lasting mark on all of us. I still remember asking, "Why do you work this hard?" and your answer, "So that no one can ever point a finger at me," left a deep impact. That one sentence taught me more than any training session ever could. <br><br>

      Because of you, the challenges that once felt big now seem small. You made us believe in ourselves and showed us how to lead by example. You didnâ€™t just complete tasks â€” you built people. You made my early career journey smoother, stronger, and more meaningful. <br><br>

      I have no doubt that youâ€™re destined for even greater heights. Keep going, sir. The top isnâ€™t just a destination for you â€” itâ€™s your natural place. Wishing you all the success and happiness that youâ€™ve truly earned.
